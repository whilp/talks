% The modification password is "uscmst2".  In site reports, it would be
% interesting to hear about what our difficulties are in getting up to
% speed in the new version of the load test.  I'll tell you as much as
% I know about the whole thing (which, alas, isn't as much as I wish I
% knew), and also the status of our plans for the T2 workshop, which is
% just two weeks away.

\section{Operations}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Disaster Recovery}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lost RAID 14 February, which badly corrupted an important AFS partition.
        \item Began immediate recovery as well as reconstruction.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Steve began long process of restoring from (non-native) AFS backups.
            \item Bockjoo reinstalled several CMSSW releases.
            \item Dan and I restored and reconfigured PhEDEx and other software.
        \end{itemize}
        \item We reconstructed most of our lost data within 24 hours; the backup took more than 72 hours to recover.
        \item We used the outage to work to avoid this single point of failure:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item All OSG apps are now mirrored on a different server.
            \item The backup volume can be brought online instantly in case of failure.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Load Test}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Resuming Participation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Problems:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Full focus on recovery, not load test.
            \item Dan and I had to spend most of our time reconstructing files.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Successful transfer, but limited rate:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We successfully transferred one dataset.
            \item More sustained transfers will allow us to demonstrate better rates.
        \end{itemize}
        \item We joined the new tests this morning.
        \item Sustained transfers should begin soon.
    \end{itemize}
