% The modification password is "uscmst2".  In the site reports, it
% might be nice to hear about what has been learned from the load test
% (some nice performance over the past two weeks!) and your readiness
% for the move to SL4.  We'll get some more information from Ian on
% what's involved in the new program of transfer tests, which are
% scheduled to start a week from now, and I'll offer some comments on
% the upcoming US T2 workshop.  The agenda:

\begin{frame}
\newframe{Load Test}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Peaked at 15T/day (30 January); currently transferring 10T/day
    \item Problems encountered during load test:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item PNFS server had mysteriously hung (Dan and I are still investigating)
        \item Other operations not affected until Monday morning
        \item After restarting PNFS, quickly resumed load test
        \item PoolManager ran out of memory; resulted in several short outages
    \end{itemize}

\newframe{Path to SL4}

\begin{itemize}
    \item All nodes will be upgraded by the end of February
    \item Most dCache pools (75T) are already running SL4
    \item Begun to work with GLOW to upgrade opportunistic resources
    \item New servers (including two new submit machines) running SL4
    \item Current status
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf SL4}: 78 CPUs, 77T
        \item {\bf SL3}: 234 CPUs, 45T
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
